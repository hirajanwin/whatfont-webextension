# WhatFont WebExtension

This is a WebExtension wrapper for Chengyin Liu's [WhatFont](http://www.chengyinliu.com/whatfont.html) script.
All icons, "whatfont_core.js", and "wf.css" were copied from his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chengyin/WhatFont-Bookmarklet).

Tested working in Firefox 63.
